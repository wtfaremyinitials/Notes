Notes from my highschool classes

Why?
====

1. I couldn't find motivation to take good notes, so I figured publishing them might help.
2. Sometimes you're crunched for time and don't have a chance to take notes yourself, so I wanted to help people out.

License
=======

These notes come with an MIT License, meaning basically: Do anything you want with these notes, but provied attribution back to me and you can't hold my liable. More information at [tldrlegal](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).

Format
======

These notes will for the most part be in the "outline" note style, and the file format will be Markdown.

The rendered output of the markdown will be available on GitHub pages.

Why should I trust you?
=======================

**You should never blindly trust information. *Especially online.*** I would always recommend fact checking any information you see online. However, these are my real notes so I have the incentive of grades to encourage me to get the facts right.

Contributing
============

I don't see why you would want to contribute to a repository of highschool notes, but if you want to, go right ahead. Just make sure to keep with the proper format and use proper grammar and spell things right.
